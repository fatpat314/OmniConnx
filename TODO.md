### on profile list page profile thumbnails should include user's specialization (and maybe whether or not they're a student?)


<!-- For the MVP I haven't included every single sub-specialty within every category because there are just too many and it makes more sense to find out exactly who will be using the app and how they're going to be using it. We still may decide that the user is going to create the subcategory specializations by entering it onto a field on their profile, or peraps through a system of hashtags on the body of their posts
So for the time being I'm leaving the lists of subgaregories here on this page.  -->

## ERRORS that need addressing ASAP- clicking 'view profile' on any profile on the 'all-profiles' page results in a 404 error.

## There's a problem when a category has too many subcategories, the page freaks out because it doesn't know how to show them. rather than a drop-down, each category containing subcategories should lead to its own page. also because some subcategories have subcategories of their own. in fact each (sub)category when clicked should lead to an index page with all the postings in that category anyways. 

## FOCUS button scrolls above the navbar for some reason
