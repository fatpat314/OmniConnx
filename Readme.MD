## Our mission is to connect the global healthcare community to crowdsource knowledge, build relationships and create careers.

## Our users are primarily going to be medical students and medical professionals, both of whom we have surveyed to find out how we might best serve them.

## Our research has revealed that the transition to practice for many new healthcare providers is challenged by:
      A lack of confidence that generally lasts an average of 5 years into the practice of new healthcare providers.
      The extreme cultural differences between the academia and the practice setting.
      Increasingly limited clinical experience caused by less patients in hospitals and increased number of students entering the healthcare field.

## Note: the user flow as it is going to happen has not yet been implemented. 
## In the current iteration of OmniConnx, users create a profile and are then able edit that profile; they can then create postings that include their avatar and a link to view their profile. We've also added commenting on the postings, and will be implementing threaded commenting so that users can interact directly on a post, as well as an in-site messenger so users can communicate with one another privately. We will be adding more questions on the profile edit page, eventually creating many subcategories as we grow our user base. Medicine has so many specialities so we've decided to let the users create the subcategories themselves.
