# OmniConnex #

## is essentially going to be a database of listings of paid opportunities with medical professionals for Med students, as well as provide means for them to communicate with one another about opportunities

## some ideas: it could be a database of opportunities that med students can register on, create a profile, upload their resumes, and apply to opportunities directly

## or, a database of med students available for paid opportunities that doctors can search when they need to hire some help ??
