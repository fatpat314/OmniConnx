## Current status of project - Initial user interviews with medical professionals have begun

## All data gathered during user interviews will be recorded on a Google Doc, which will be posted on our Trello board.

## is essentially going to be a database of listings of paid opportunities with medical professionals for Med students, as well as provide means for them to communicate with one another about opportunities

## some ideas: it could be a database of opportunities that med students can register on, create a profile, upload their resumes, and apply to opportunities directly

## or, a database of med students available for paid opportunities that doctors can search when they need to hire some help ??
