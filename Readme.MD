# OmniConnex #

## Next steps:

## Index page - weâ€™re looking for a call to action, something to prompt the user to click, along the lines of the homepage on this site: https://www.magiclinks.com/

## Content video for presenting the site - a screencast that mimics exactly what the User Experience will be. Pay attention to detail. 

## We need a solid Roadmap and Trello board for the rest of the project.
