# OmniConnex #

## Next steps:

## Index page - weâ€™re looking for a call to action, something to prompt the user to click, along the lines of the homepage on this site: https://www.magiclinks.com/

## Content video for presenting the site - a screencast that mimics exactly what the User Experience will be. Pay attention to detail. 

## We need a solid Roadmap and Trello board for the rest of the project. we should also try to be more intentional about our sprints.

## animated_lotus_icon by Gideon: gscrawley.github.io/animated_lotus/lotus.html

## it would be nice to try to integrate the miniaturized logo into the navbar

## Sofiya's suggesting that we consider using Adalo to build the backend faster; it does look cool and is worth checking out but I'm not sure how that would fly with Dan and Kami.
