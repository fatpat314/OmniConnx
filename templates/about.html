<h3>About OmniConnx</h3>

<p><strong>Finding answers can be hard.</strong> </p>
Whether you’re interested in going to medical school and want to find a solution which suits you, 
seeking career opportunities, mentorship, a side gig, or simply which textbook best suits your learning style… 
gathering and going through all of the options is time consuming, and too often the answers you find are contradictory, vague, or non conclusive. </p>

<p>The global medical community is vast, full of learners and leaders in every medical discipline. 
We've built the OmniConnx portal to make it easier for you to instantly connect in order to
share ideas, information, questions, and opportunities to work together.</p>

<p><strong>Our mission is to connect you to the global healthcare community to crowdsource knowledge, build relationships and create careers.</strong></p>

<p><ul>The transition to practice for many new healthcare providers is challenged by:
<li>A lack of confidence that statistically lasts an average of 5 years into the practice of new healthcare providers. </li>
<li>The extreme cultural differences between the academia and the practice setting.</li>
<li>Increasingly limited options to gain clinical experience caused by less patients in hospitals and increased number of students entering the healthcare field.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Through our database filled with unique talent, we will gladly welcome you to become another talent who grows and helps others grow 
by sharing your knowledge and enthusiasm for education. </p>
