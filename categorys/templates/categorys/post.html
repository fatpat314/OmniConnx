{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
This is currently just a placeholder. I still need to make the routes <br>
dynamic to each post. Which does not have a model yet. But this page will just <br>
import information to whatever template you build. <br>
<br>
<br>
Later we are going to need to figure out a few placement things,<br>
but we can worry about that later.<br>
